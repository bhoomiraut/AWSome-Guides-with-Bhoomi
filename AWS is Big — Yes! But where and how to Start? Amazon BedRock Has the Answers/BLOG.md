**AWS is Big ‚Äî Yes! But where and how to Start? Amazon BedRock Has the Answers.** 

`By- Bhoomi Ganesh Raut`

Are You Just Starting with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud? But exactly where and how to start?
This is exactly where I was. I started with AWS Cloud Services when I became an AWS Cloud Club Captain. But I was confused and always asking experts about the roadmap.

That‚Äôs the reason why I built my own personalized AWS mentor using AWS PartyRock- an Amazon Bedrock Playground, to help myself and others who are starting, just like I did.

**What are AWS PartyRock and Amazon Bedrock?**
AWS PartyRock- a Generative AI app development platform with a fun trial and hit. It allows anyone (tech or non-tech) to build without writing code, with just a simple prompt. Ohh!!.. just prompt?!
> Note: Go through basic knowledge of ‚Äúhow to give an optimized prompt.‚Äù

***Amazon BedRock***- a fully managed AWS Service that gives access to foundational models (FMs) from Amazon and leading AI providers through an API.
With PartyRock, we can build:
- Personalized Coach
- Business mentor
- Animation Image Creator
- Anything you wish, you can innovate and share (https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/11/partyrock-amazon-bedrock-playground/)

**My Generative AI App-**
[AWS at your Fingertip: Learn any Service, at any time, and anywhere!](https://partyrock.aws/u/bhoomi01/gBwfkvBam/AWS-at-your-Fingertip%3A-Learn-any-Service-anywhere)

Input any AWS Service name, like AWS S3, EC2, Lambda, Redshift, etc‚Ä¶
then just Ctrl + Enter ‚Üí
