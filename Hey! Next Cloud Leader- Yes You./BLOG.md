## Every leader starts somewhere — mine started with a doubt!  
When I first saw the word **“global”** in the *AWS Cloud Club Captain Cohort* description, I paused.  
I thought, *“Global? Me? From a rural background? Maybe this isn’t for me.”*  
Fast forward a bit — and life came full circle.

From my small-town beginnings, I somehow ended up hosting the **first-ever AWS Cloud Clubs cross-region event — Indo–Hong Kong — as an expert speaker!** *(Yes, I still grin every time I say that.)*

And trust me, it only happened because of the amazing **AWS family** — the support, the encouragement, and the endless “you’ve got this!” moments.

## From small beginnings to 600+ learners

When I introduced **AWS Cloud Clubs** on our campus, we started with almost no cloud awareness.  
But with constant effort and belief, that small start brought together **600+ enthusiastic learners** discovering AWS for the first time at *AWS Cloud Discovery Day.*

That’s when I discovered my hidden champ within.  
It’s where I learned that leadership isn’t just about leading — it’s about **creating the next generation of leaders.**

## Passing the baton forward

And honestly, passing on the baton to the next captains was one of the best parts.  
I saw students — especially the girls — curiously stepping up, taking ownership, and dreaming big about leading next.  
That’s when I thought, *yep, this is what impact feels like.*

Not long after, I got invited as an **Expert Speaker by Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW)** — a room full of passionate, curious, and confident women ready to take the stage next.  
It felt like everything had come full circle — from empowering young students at my own campus to now sharing space with the next generation of **future women leaders in tech.**

## For the Students, By the Students

And then came one of my favourite initiatives — **“For the Students, By the Students.”**

In the early days, speaker availability was a real challenge, especially in rural areas.  
So I decided to wear all the hats — I was the organiser, the volunteer, the speaker, the learner, and somehow… also the leader.

Each session was chaotic and unpredictable, but so full of joy.  
Watching students teach, share, and explore AWS concepts together felt like seeing a **mini tech revolution** unfold in real time.

That’s what **AWS Cloud Clubs** are really about — students leading students, turning learning into something **real, fun, and meaningful.**

## Why You Should Apply

Because it’s not just a title — it’s a **ticket to opportunities you didn’t even know existed.**

As a captain, I got:

- **AWS credits** that helped me turn small ideas into real projects  
- **Certification vouchers** … and yes, I cracked it 😄  
- **Free learning resources** that made my certification journey smoother  
- **Exclusive sessions** with AWS product teams — where you hear insights straight from the people who build the cloud  
- And the fun twist — I even got invited to apply for **AWS New Voices Speaker Training**… and guess what? I got selected!  
  *(Still a “someone pinch me” moment!)*  
- And yes, I’ll confirm the rumor — the **AWS swag really is that cool.**

But the best part?  
You’ll collect **stories that stay with you** — moments where curiosity meets confidence, and community turns into family.
